<p>My phone is like my other half. It's the first thing I hold in the morning and the last thing I let go of at night and I've been so frustrated about that fact.
                </br></br>
                I know it's not the phone but my discipline, I've been a couch potato this whole quarantine and have not pursued things I'm supposed to be finishing. I gained weight and didn't continue with exercise, I haven't read books in my book queue, haven't coded my personal website,  shopped unnecessarily, and not pursued online classes I want to finish. 
                </br></br>
                This is like a suicide mission, I know the house is burning but I'm watching myself burn in it. I see every day the negative impacts of this phone addiction but still as if my conscience is lying to myself that this is justifiable, and it is not. 
                </br></br> 
                From reading different philosophy books I learned the importance of self-control and being in touch with reality. I am prone to overthinking and falsely analyzing things, which has bought me great problems. Now with this problem why am I stuck if I know that solution to my problem? it's so difficult to move and act, the discipline that I progressed the past year has been gone the past months. 
                </br></br>   
                Now I am in deep sorrow and contemplation accompanied by panic and chaotic voices in my head. All of this from a single rectangular device that is an extension of myself. I'm drowning, I can save myself but why do I not chose to? 
                </br></br>  
                All I can advise myself is: Dont Be Stupid, and Wake Up. </p>

        <h2> Charlie and the "Vit"</h2>
        <h5>comedy | true story, July 17, 2020 </h5>
        <img src="charlie.jpg" alt="Charlie the Dog"> 
        <p>It was the year 2017, my vacation was going all well until one unfaithful event....
        </p>
        <p>It was school break and I got a chance to visit my parents and my brother in New Zealand. I had the cheapest flight bought by my parents (I'm not complaining), it was 19-hours travel time and that's when I realize how much I hated airplane food. I have nothing against China Airlines but their food tasted like a masterpiece of a broke college student with only a microwave as a stove -- It tasted something I would cook, thus I hated it. I was also flying with my cousin, he snores loud and it took me a few considerable hours being anxious and scared that he'll snore too loud and wake everyone in the plane. </p>
        <p>After 19 hours and 3 different planes, we arrived in Wellington, I was welcomed with a cool breeze. When we got home from a 2-hour drive, we arrived at the house my parents were living in it was beautiful and it looked like a cabin for murder scenes, I loved it!! Seeing my brother, Magii, gave me the feeling of authority from being an "ate" (big sister) again, I missed bullying him. </p>
        <p>So few days have passed, I was enjoying my stay in our cabin-like house when my mama said that there's a dog I will be babysitting and I would get paid, I get to hang out with a dog and get paid?! BEST 3 DAYS EVER. </p>
        <p>It was a disaster. (not the dog though he was the best!)</p>
        <p>Charlie, a Jack Russell terrier, is used to having a big land to run to. He was a true New Zealander dog running wild and free in the green grass and fresh air. Our house was nothing like that, we had a fair amount of grass but no fences so he can get to the main road. So this is where it gets interesting, Magii and I were biking around the neighborhood having fun when we get a sudden call from our mama that Charlie got away, again (it was not the first time).  So we hurriedly got back and searched around the neighborhood and looked to places he usually ran to. We couldn't find him. Until we got to the main road where there are a lot more cars going around. I saw him, about to cross the street and I got a bad feeling. </p>
        <p>Charlie got hit by a car right before my eyes. </p>
        <p>Magii and I ran over to him to check what happened. There he was laying in the middle of the road crying, so I was crying too. I didn't know what to do, and all I can remember is that my papa told me that they have dog ambulances in New Zealand so I told my cousin to call the police or the ambulance -- I looked like a fool. </p>
        <p>So there I was in the middle of the road of a foreign country, with foreign people watching me dramatically hold into Charlie. Then I got into my senses, I had to do something so I carried Charlie and sat down by the curb, then my greatest fear happened. People started circling around me asking to help. Now the worst part is I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. The Kiwi accent was so confusing and it made me cry more. 
            </br></br>
            One woman said, "Do you want to take him to the vit?" , I was so confused, what the hell is a vit?!?! it was not helping with my current embarrassing state. 
            </br></br>
            Then after a few incomprehensible statements from locals gathered around me, a car appeared and it was people from the nearby animal clinic, I was amazed! If I was in the Philippines Charlie would have been taken as "adobong aso" in the nearby carinderia**. And so, we were in the clinic and Charlie was ok, just a few complications nothing serious, we just had to pay a few dollars for his check-up with his veterinarian. 
            </br></br>
            Charlie was ok, but my dignity was not. 
            </br></br>
            (BTW, "vit" was vet. I realized a few hours after. New Zealanders pronounce their E as I)
        </br></br></br>
            
            ** My friend Bea said the Adobong Aso is too much. No, most Filipinos do not eat dogs. It was just an exaggeration. </p>

        <h2>Newcomer Fears</h2>
        <h5>comedy | true story, July 14, 2020</h5>
        <p>    I started studying in Mapua last year (2019). Mapua was a culture shock for me considering that I came from an all-girls school for the last 8 years prior to transferring; having male classmates was traumatizing! I remember enrolling in Mapua Makati for the first time, I was anxious and scared that I was like sweating the entire Pasig River (yes that disgusting!) My heart raced when I was surrounded by mostly men not because of "kilig" but of fear!! 
            </br></br>
            First class, Computer Programming, a completely alien topic to me and the teacher discussed everything as if everyone were an expert (one tear fell from my eye). I was a Philippine Maya bird in a Brazilian forest filled with beautiful birds. In other words, I felt stupid. I studied, researched, cried, read, and cried again. In the end, I passed the subject but failed the laboratory class, yes I failed a subject in my first term in Mapua. 
            </br></br>
            I also joined an org because I was feeling brave and wanted to make friends, I was so excited that when they asked me to be an officer I immediately answered yes, the WORST IDEA EVER! I had no idea what the org was about! I was surrounded by mostly men, cigarette smelling men, few women, and my femininity was overpowered and intimidated. I was 10 minutes late because I wanted to look cool and effortless, again, the WORST IDEA EVER. Everyone looked at me when I entered the room and I was like an ice cream melting over a spotlight! Cara became a melted ice cream in front of her fellow officers. 
            </br></br>
            I have lots of embarrassing and awkward stories in Mapua in the short span of the past 8 months I was on campus and I will tell you more in the future. For now, this is all I can tell you because I can't reminiscence these embarrassing moments anymore.
            </br></br>
        That's it! Thank you for reading, my invisible fans! 
            </br></br>
        your awkward friend ðŸ˜Š,
